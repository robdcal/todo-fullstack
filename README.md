# To Do App - Full Stack (PERN)

Full stack todo app using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node).

## To Do (ha!)

- ~~Convert to Typescript~~
- ~~Allow for crossing off to do list item~~
- ~~Move completed items to separate list / show them at the end of the list~~
- ~~Improve styling / use Material UI~~
- ~~Host app~~
- Display "loading..." visuals while waiting for data from server/db
- Improve visuals further (Material UI theme?)
- Make it work for multiple individual users (not a shared todo list)
- Move to a faster database, like Firebase Realtime (NoSQL)
